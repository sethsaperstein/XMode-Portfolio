# XMode-Portfolio

XMode is an ad-tech startup, based out of Reston, Virginia, that aims to power innovation with quality location data. XMode's SDK collects location data from app publishers around the globe, which is later used for advertisers attempting to target segments of the population.

During my time at XMode, I worked on two main projects, which I'll refer to as the "stock returns project" and the "home/work prediction project". Although time was also spent on smaller data cleaning and analysis tasks, my team, consisting of 3 data science interns, focused primarily on these two projects.

## [Stock Returns](./home_work_project/home-work.ipynb)

Since X-Mode sees the location of 10 million people per month, it makes sense that they can measure foot traffic in retail stores and make predictions on how a company is doing. In the stock_returns notebook, I analyzed the theoretical returns if investors were to trade on revenue predictions based off of location data. A member of my team, Aaron Gu, also made a [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/blogmode/mad-money-data-edition-bab8e7faaaaf) on our work and its applications in the financial sector. From my work, X-Mode is actively marketing to hedge funds to incorporate location data into their trading algorithms.

## [Home and Work Predictions](./stock_project/stock_returns.ipynb)

Another powerful use of location data is determining someone's home or work. I conducted a proof of concept study to see if X-Mode could find home and work on users' data points, and found that users with more than 500 data points per month were able to be detected. I'll leave the use cases to X-Mode in the future, but some I thought of were taking these private data points out of the sold data, or modifying data collection when the user is at home or work to reduce phone battery usage.

## Takeaways

XMode gave me the unique experience of working at a fast-paced startup in an emerging industry- alternative data. What we can do with data has only skimmed the surface of what is possible. As a result, I was able to witness firsthand the evergrowing conflict between privacy/security and innovation, as GDPR had just been put into effect. I also had the opportunity to be part of a company that, in just 2 months, hired 5 new employees and moved offices to enable further growth. While my entrepreneurial and innovative spirit has always been present, working with CEO Joshua Anton has inspired me even more. I hope to continue to travel down these nontraditional routes of unexplored territory in the years to come and can't wait to see what comes next!
