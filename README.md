# XMode-Portfolio

The summer after my freshman year, I interned at an ad-tech startup called X-Mode in Reston, Virginia. They provide their location SDK to mobile app developers to help them monetize, and then collect location data. This data can be used for advertisers who want to target segments of the population, like the people who went to Walmart.

My two main projects this summer were the stock returns project and the home/work project. I also worked a lot on data cleaning and analysis.

Since X-Mode sees the location of 10 million people per month, it makes sense that they can measure foot traffic in retail stores and make predictions on how a company is doing. In the stock_returns notebook, I analyzed the theoretical returns if investors were to trade on revenue predictions based off of location data. I also made a [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/blogmode/mad-money-data-edition-bab8e7faaaaf) on my work and its applications in the financial sector. From my work, X-Mode is actively marketing to hedge funds to incorporate location data into their trading algorithms.

Another powerful use of location data is determining someone's home or work. I conducted a proof of concept study to see if X-Mode could find home and work on users' data points, and found that users with more than 500 data points per month were able to be detected. I'll leave the use cases to X-Mode in the future, but some I thought of were taking these private data points out of the sold data, or modifying data collection when the user is at home or work.

## Takeaways

I'm very fortunate to have had the chance to work at a fast-paced startup, using the data science skills I learned in school and becoming very proficient with Python Pandas. I saw the company deal with GDPR compliance, hire 5 new employees, and move into a new office within the span of two months. Working and talking with the CEO, Joshua Anton, has inspired an entrepreneurial spirit inside of me, and I'll probably start some ventures in the near future.# XMode-Portfolio
